# Convention Learning Through Systematic Codebase Analysis

**Core Purpose:** Extract established patterns from codebase and transform them into imperative coding conventions for CLAUDE.md.

## Execution Flow

1. **File Sampling** → @pragmatic-engineer samples critical files using git history + mandatory paths
2. **Core Pattern Analysis** → @fullstack-engineer analyzes naming, structure, imports, types, async, errors
3. **Security Pattern Analysis** → @security-engineer analyzes auth, validation, SQL, secrets, API security
4. **Data Pattern Analysis** → @database-specialist analyzes state, API calls, database access, caching
5. **Convention Synthesis** → @claude-code-expert transforms patterns into imperative rules (>70% consistency)
6. **Security Baseline Application** → @security-engineer applies mandatory security rules
7. **CLAUDE.md Update** → @claude-code-expert updates CONVENTIONS section

## Step 1: Strategic File Sampling

**Execute via @pragmatic-engineer:** Sample codebase for pattern analysis

### Sampling Strategy Selection
Based on argument:
- **standard** → 10-15 files (quick analysis)
- **deep** → 20-50 files (comprehensive analysis)
- **full** → ALL significant files (exhaustive analysis: source code, scripts, configs, tests, docs)

**FULL MODE WARNING:** This mode analyzes hundreds to thousands of files and may take 30-60+ minutes depending on codebase size. Operation includes progress tracking, batch processing, and resumability features.

### Mandatory Critical Path Sampling
Execute these searches in order:

**For standard/deep modes:**
1. **Security/Auth paths:** `find . \( -path "*/auth/*" -o -path "*/security/*" \) | head -4`
2. **Core business paths:** `find . \( -path "*/models/*" -o -path "*/db/*" -o -path "*/api/*" \) | head -4`
3. **Configuration files:** `ls -la *config* .env* 2>/dev/null | head -2`

**For full mode - Comprehensive File Discovery:**
1. **Source Code Files:** `find . -type f \( -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.rs" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.php" -o -name "*.rb" -o -name "*.cs" -o -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.c" \) ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/vendor/*" ! -path "*/.git/*" ! -path "*/dist/*" ! -path "*/build/*"`
2. **Configuration Files:** `find . -type f \( -name "*.json" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.toml" -o -name "*.ini" -o -name "*.conf" -o -name "*config*" -o -name ".env*" \) ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*"`
3. **Build/Automation Scripts:** `find . -type f \( -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.bash" -o -name "*.zsh" -o -name "*.fish" -o -name "Makefile" -o -name "makefile" -o -name "*.mk" -o -name "*.ps1" -o -name "*.bat" -o -name "*.cmd" \) ! -path "*/.git/*"`
4. **Docker/Deployment:** `find . -type f \( -name "Dockerfile*" -o -name "docker-compose*" -o -name "*.dockerfile" -o -name "*.k8s.yaml" -o -name "*.k8s.yml" -o -name "helm-*" -o -name "Chart.yaml" \)`
5. **Package Management:** `find . -type f \( -name "package.json" -o -name "package-lock.json" -o -name "yarn.lock" -o -name "Pipfile*" -o -name "requirements*.txt" -o -name "Cargo.toml" -o -name "Cargo.lock" -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "go.sum" -o -name "composer.json" -o -name "Gemfile*" \)`
6. **CI/CD Configurations:** `find . -type f -path "*/.github/workflows/*" -o -path "*/.gitlab-ci*" -o -path "*/jenkins/*" -o -name ".travis.yml" -o -name "buildkite.yml" -o -name "azure-pipelines.yml"`
7. **Test Files:** `find . -type f \( -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" -o -path "*/test/*" -o -path "*/tests/*" -o -path "*/__tests__/*" -o -path "*/spec/*" \) ! -path "*/node_modules/*"`
8. **Documentation with Code:** `find . -type f -name "*.md" -path "*/docs/*" -o -name "README*.md" -o -name "CONTRIBUTING*.md" -o -name "CHANGELOG*.md"`

### Git-Based Smart Sampling
Execute git analysis for frequently changed files:
1. **Most modified files:** `git log --pretty=format: --name-only -30 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rg | head -5`
2. **Recent changes:** `git diff HEAD~10 --name-only | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx|py|go|rs)$' | head -3`

### File Selection Protocol

**For standard/deep modes:**
Create file list `.strategy/conventions/sampled-files.txt` with:
- All mandatory critical path files found
- Top git-analyzed files
- Ensure coverage: frontend, backend, database, config, tests
- Target total: 10-15 (standard) or 20-50 (deep)

**For full mode:**
Execute comprehensive analysis with batch processing:

### Full Mode Execution Protocol
**Stage 1 - Discovery and Batching:**
1. **Execute all file discovery commands** listed above
2. **Merge results into master file list** `.strategy/conventions/full-files-master.txt`
3. **Filter out binaries, logs, and generated files** 
4. **Estimate total processing time** based on file count (avg 2-5 seconds per file)
5. **Split into batches** of 75-100 files each
6. **Create batch processing queue** `.strategy/conventions/batch-queue.txt`
7. **Initialize progress tracking** `.strategy/conventions/progress.json`

**Stage 2 - Batch Processing Loop:**
For each batch in queue:
1. **Mark batch as in-progress** in progress tracker
2. **Execute pattern analysis** on batch files using core analysis steps
3. **Save batch results** to `.strategy/conventions/batch-[n]-results.md`
4. **Update progress tracker** with completion status
5. **Clear memory/cache** between batches to prevent resource exhaustion
6. **Create checkpoint** every 3 batches for resumability

**Stage 3 - Consolidation and Synthesis:**
1. **Merge all batch results** into unified pattern analysis
2. **Calculate weighted consistency scores** (core files weighted higher than tests/configs)
3. **Generate comprehensive statistics** for all pattern categories
4. **Create detailed coverage report** showing analysis completeness
5. **Apply security baseline** and synthesize final conventions

**For full mode - Comprehensive File Collection:**

1. **Initialize Progress Tracking:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .strategy/conventions/full-mode
   echo "FULL_MODE_STATUS=INITIALIZING" > .strategy/conventions/full-mode/status.env
   echo "START_TIME=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')" >> .strategy/conventions/full-mode/status.env
   echo "TOTAL_FILES=0" >> .strategy/conventions/full-mode/status.env
   echo "PROCESSED_FILES=0" >> .strategy/conventions/full-mode/status.env
   ```

2. **Collect All File Categories:**
   Create separate lists for each category:
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/source-files.txt` (all source code)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/config-files.txt` (all configuration)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/script-files.txt` (all build/automation)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/docker-files.txt` (all deployment)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/package-files.txt` (all package management)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/ci-files.txt` (all CI/CD configs)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/test-files.txt` (all test files)
   - `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/doc-files.txt` (all documentation)

3. **Create Master File List:**
   Combine all category files into `.strategy/conventions/full-mode/all-files.txt`
   Calculate total count and update status:
   ```bash
   wc -l .strategy/conventions/full-mode/all-files.txt | cut -d' ' -f1 > .strategy/conventions/full-mode/total-count.txt
   echo "TOTAL_FILES=$(cat .strategy/conventions/full-mode/total-count.txt)" >> .strategy/conventions/full-mode/status.env
   ```

4. **Batch Size Configuration:**
   - **Small codebase (<100 files):** Process all at once
   - **Medium codebase (100-500 files):** Batches of 50 files
   - **Large codebase (500-2000 files):** Batches of 25 files  
   - **Huge codebase (>2000 files):** Batches of 15 files

5. **Memory Management Protocol:**
   - Process files in order of importance: source → config → scripts → tests → docs
   - Save progress after each batch to enable resumability
   - Clear temporary analysis data between batches
   - Use incremental pattern accumulation instead of holding all patterns in memory

**Output:** Complete categorized file collection with batch processing plan and progress tracking system

## Content Routing Protocol

### CLAUDE.md Content (Imperative Rules Only):
- Naming conventions with >70% consistency
- File organization patterns with >70% consistency  
- Import/export patterns with >70% consistency
- Type definition patterns with >70% consistency
- Async patterns with >70% consistency
- Error handling patterns with >70% consistency
- Security baseline rules (mandatory, regardless of consistency)
- Data management patterns with >70% consistency

### CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md Content (Assessments & Recommendations):
- Security findings and recommendations
- Pattern consistency statistics and percentages
- Architecture assessment and improvement suggestions
- Conflicting patterns with resolution guidance
- Files analyzed and coverage statistics
- Patterns below 70% consistency with recommendations
- Historical analysis and trend identification

## Step 5: Convention Rule Synthesis

**Execute via @claude-code-expert:** Transform identified patterns into imperative coding rules

### Pattern Filtering Protocol
For each identified pattern:
1. **Consistency check:** Only include patterns >70% consistent
2. **Clarity validation:** Ensure pattern is clearly defined
3. **Actionability test:** Confirm pattern can be expressed as imperative rule
4. **Conflict resolution:** Resolve conflicting patterns by choosing most consistent

### Imperative Rule Transformation
Convert each validated pattern to imperative format:
- **FROM:** "Components use PascalCase (85% consistent)"
- **TO:** "Use PascalCase for React components"

- **FROM:** "API calls use async/await (92% consistent)"
- **TO:** "Use async/await for API calls"

### Rule Organization
Group rules into logical categories:
- **Naming Conventions**
- **File Organization**
- **Import/Export Style**
- **Type Definitions**
- **Async Patterns**
- **Error Handling**
- **Security Practices**
- **Data Management**

**Output:** Synthesized rules saved to `.strategy/conventions/imperative-rules.md`

## Step 6a: Security Baseline Rule Integration

**Execute via @security-engineer:** Apply mandatory security rules for CLAUDE.md conventions

### Security Baseline Rules (ALWAYS APPLY TO CLAUDE.md)
Add these imperative rules to conventions regardless of current codebase patterns:

1. **Require authentication for protected endpoints**
2. **Validate all user input at application boundaries**
3. **Use parameterized queries for all database access**
4. **Enforce HTTPS in production environments**
5. **Manage secrets via environment variables only**
6. **Implement rate limiting on public APIs**
7. **Ensure error messages never leak system details**

**Output:** Security baseline rules added to `.strategy/conventions/imperative-rules.md`

## Step 6b: Security Assessment Documentation

**Execute via @security-engineer:** Document security findings and recommendations for CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md

### Security Assessment Content
Document detailed security analysis findings:
1. **Security gaps identified** in current codebase patterns
2. **Risk assessment** for discovered security antipatterns
3. **Detailed recommendations** for security improvements
4. **Priority classification** of security fixes needed
5. **Implementation guidance** for security improvements
6. **Compliance assessment** against security baseline

### Security Integration Analysis
1. Review synthesized rules for security gaps
2. Identify security patterns below 70% consistency
3. Document security antipatterns found
4. Provide specific remediation steps

**Output:** Security assessment and recommendations in `.strategy/conventions/security-assessment.md`

## Step 7: CLAUDE.md Integration

**Execute via @claude-code-expert:** Update project CLAUDE.md with discovered conventions (create if absent)

### CONVENTIONS Section Update Protocol

1. **Backup existing CLAUDE.md** to `.strategy/conventions/claude-backup-[timestamp].md`
2. **Locate CONVENTIONS section** in CLAUDE.md or create if missing
3. **Preserve custom rules** - any rules marked as "custom" or "manual"
4. **Filter content by type:**
   - CLAUDE.md gets ONLY imperative rules with >70% consistency + security baseline
   - CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md gets assessments, statistics, recommendations, and findings
5. **Separate analytical content** - move all assessments to CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md
6. **Add analysis metadata** - timestamp, files analyzed, consistency thresholds

**Output:** Updated CLAUDE.md with extracted conventions and analysis files in `.strategy/conventions/`

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### Standard Mode (Default)
- Sample 10-15 files using mandatory + git-based selection
- Focus on most critical patterns
- Generate core convention rules
- Complete analysis in single session

### Deep Analysis Mode
**ALWAYS create CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md when:**
- User specifies "deep", "thorough", or "comprehensive"
- More than 15 files are analyzed
- Security recommendations need to be documented
- Any assessments or statistics are generated

### Full Analysis Mode
**MANDATORY for "full" mode operations:**
- **ALWAYS create CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md** with comprehensive statistics
- **Enable batch processing** with progress tracking and resumability
- **Generate detailed coverage reports** showing analysis completeness
- **Include weighted pattern consistency** (core files weighted higher)
- **Document resource usage** and processing time statistics
- **Provide batch-by-batch breakdown** of discovered patterns
- **Create implementation timeline** based on pattern complexity and consistency

**Deep Analysis Mode Execution:**
- Sample 20-50 files with extended coverage
- Include architectural and team patterns from git history
- Generate comprehensive CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md with detailed statistics
- Classify patterns as strong/emerging/no convention
- Provide prioritized recommendations for improving consistency
- Include implementation guidance and timeline suggestions

**Standard Mode with CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md:**
Even in standard mode, create CONVENTION_ANALYSIS.md if:
- Security assessment findings exist
- Pattern inconsistencies need documentation
- Architectural recommendations are identified

## Project Focus Areas (Optional)
When user specifies focus area:
- **frontend** → Emphasize React/UI patterns, component conventions
- **backend** → Focus on API, database, service patterns
- **security** → Deep dive on auth, validation, secrets management
- **data** → Emphasize database, state management, API patterns

Adjust file sampling and analysis depth based on specified focus.

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Pattern Conflicts
When patterns conflict (multiple conventions with similar consistency):
1. **Security patterns** always take precedence
2. **Most recent patterns** (git history) preferred over legacy
3. **Framework/library conventions** preferred over custom patterns
4. **Document conflicts** in analysis files for user review

### Insufficient Pattern Data
When <70% consistency found:
1. **Note pattern inconsistency** in analysis
2. **Skip rule generation** for inconsistent patterns
3. **Apply security baseline** regardless
4. **Recommend pattern standardization** in analysis

### Analysis Completion Guarantee
Ensure all seven steps complete even if individual steps encounter issues:
1. **Continue with partial data** if file sampling fails
2. **Apply security baseline** even if pattern analysis incomplete
3. **Update CLAUDE.md** with whatever rules were successfully extracted
4. **Document any issues** in analysis files
